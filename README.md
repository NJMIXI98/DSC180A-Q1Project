# DSC180A-Methodology-2
Create a private GitHub repository with the directories and files mentioned in the lesson: src/, notebooks/, config/, references/, run.py, .gitignore, and README.md. (It doesn’t matter what you name your repository, but if you want a name, use DSC180A-Methodology-2.)

Create “stub files” in the directories as placeholders as well. Stub files can be empty, but should have the correct extensions. For example, if a directory will inevitably have Python source code, place an empty file in the directory called stub.py. (Note that empty directories won’t appear on GitHub, so you’ll need to place a stub file in every directory you create.)

Your .gitignore file should have appropriate content.
